### About me
As a Mobile Developer, I seek to accurately develop the interface and experience created by the designer, bring the performance expected by the user and in addition the reuse of the components created so that, thus, there is a better use with quality and speed.

Seeing the projects take shape visually is what fascinates me and makes me love the front end. I love technology, and knowing that I can contribute to improving people's experience through it is rewarding. I value cultivating friendships and adding to people's lives in some positive way. In addition, I always try to do my best and I am in constant search for excellence and professional growth, facing challenges and learning from each of them.
